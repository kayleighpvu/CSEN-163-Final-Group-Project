Over the span of a few weeks, we built a simple web application called the "Virtual Thrift Buddy" using HTML, CSS, Javascript purposed to:
* Help users (thrift-shop lovers, eco-friendly shoppers, etc.) quickly and efficiently find nearby thrift stores to save them money and time
* Allow users to virtually visualize the clothings from different stores' inventories beforehand using Augmented Reality
* Promote mindful consumerism and sustainability

Future Steps with this project:
* Improve the User Interface
* Expand to more advanced frameworks (ReactJS, NodeJS)
* Build the backend to pull thrift store APIs
* Build the augmented reality using existing libraries for the web
